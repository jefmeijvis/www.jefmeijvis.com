Enable **Prompt API for Gemini Nano** setting

> Enables the exploratory Prompt API, allowing you to send natural language instructions to a built-in large language model (Gemini Nano in Chrome). Exploratory APIs are designed for local prototyping to help discover potential use cases, and may never launch. These explorations will inform the built-in AI roadmap [1]. This API is primarily intended for natural language processing tasks such as summarizing, classifying, or rephrasing text. It is NOT suitable for use cases that require factual accuracy (e.g. answering knowledge questions). You must comply with our Prohibited Use Policy [2] which provides additional details about appropriate use of Generative AI. â€“ Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, Lacros
