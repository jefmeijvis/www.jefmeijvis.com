## Visiting Techorama 2024!

A new year, a new Techorama. This year we once attended [Techorama](https://www.techorama.be), a premier technology conference that gathers tech enthusiasts, developers, and industry leaders from around the world. Held in the city of Antwerp, Belgium, the event was a melting pot of innovation, learning, and networking. Hereâ€™s a look into the experience at Techorama.

[dotNET lab](https://www.dotnetlab.eu) embraced the funfair theme with an interactive booth. We set up a slot machine, attracting a stream of visitors eager to try their luck. Attendees had a blast playing the game, hoping to win one of the main prizes.

Techorama 2024 was fully packed, featuring nine dedicated rooms where 120 speakers delivered 150 sessions. Below is a picture of the biggest and main speaker room:
